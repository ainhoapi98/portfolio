# My portfolio

In this project, I show several widgets and functionalities that serve as a show case of my React skills.

This is a single page react application, mostly written in Typescript.

## Pages (wip)
### Homepage
A dashboard of several widgets:

#### Todo list Widget
Allows the user to create, edit, and delete tasks. Each item contains a name, a date, and a checkbox indicating wether the task has been completed or not.
It also contains a filter to filter the tasks by their completion status.

#### Weather Widget
Shows the current weather forecast for the selected city. Default is Berlin.
